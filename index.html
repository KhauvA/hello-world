      Hello. I’m Alex Khauv. I’m a hospitality designer. What does that mean? Well, I’m not sure either. I <br>
      enjoy creating welcoming environments that help to make people’s days . At first I thought this meant <br>
      going into the field of politics to improve the community, but later on I realized I could have a greater <br> 
      reach with technology. Now I look for ways to design technology to be more friendly and <br>
      accommodating to people. <br>
